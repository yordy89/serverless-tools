## Editing the swagger API file

The swagger editor should be used to edit the swagger file, to reduce the risk of typos.

### Prerequisites

The Node.js swagger-api package should be installed:

```shell
sudo npm install -g swagger
```

### Running the editor

You can run the following from the buy-chain project **root directory**:

```shell
swagger project edit
```

Any changes in the editor are saved immediately.
